# STA-Algorithm
An Algorithm solving the student-topics-assignement (STA) problem using applied combinatorics.

The math is brought together and explained in **doc/algorithmic_matching**.  
To know more about the project check out files in **doc/** or the pdf in **present/**.  
The compiled code is in **out/**.

The src-code is my adaoption of the network-flow algorithm from _A Java Library of Graph Algorithms and Optimization_ by _H.T.Lau_

Giving you an idea of the graph-model:
